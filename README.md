# Data-Visualization-Team-Project

Brief articulation -

We are building an informative website focused on the education of HIV on an international level relative to certain years. The homepage will display basic information on HIV such as:  
  
-What is HIV  
-Where did HIV come from  
-Stages of HIV  
-How many people are living with HIV in the world (includes a map of all countries, year, and percentage of people with HIV)  
  
We will have different tabs within our website focused on the following tab topics and info subtopics:  
  
1) Preventions:   
-Education   
-Methods(prep)  
-Testing (different testing methods)  

2) Treatments- Determine if there is a correlation/relationship - a decrease in HIV death rates in relation to the introduction of ART and other treatments.  
-ART  
-Drugs  
-Life Expectancy (Line Graph of 1950-2015 centered on specific countries with high rates of HIV rates according to people living with HIV)

3) Deaths (Bar chart of the last 5 years for all countries)  
4) Donate
