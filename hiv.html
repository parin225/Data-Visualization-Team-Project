                        <h2>What is HIV?</h2>
                        <hr>
                            <p>HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency 
                            syndrome, or AIDS, if not treated. Unlike some other viruses, the human body can’t get rid of HIV completely,
                            even with treatment. So once you get HIV, you have it for life.</p>
                            <p>HIV attacks the body’s immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), which help the immune system fight 
                            off infections. Untreated, HIV reduces the number of CD4 cells (T cells) in the body, making the person more likely 
                            to get other infections or infection-related cancers. Over time, HIV can destroy so many of these cells that the body can’t 
                            fight off infections and disease. These opportunistic infections or cancers take advantage of a very weak immune system and 
                            signal that the person has AIDS, the last stage of HIV infection.</p> 
                            <p>No effective cure currently exists, but with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. The medicine used to treat HIV is 
                            called antiretroviral therapy or ART. If taken the right way, every day, this medicine can dramatically prolong the lives of 
                            many people infected with HIV, keep them healthy, and greatly lower their chance of infecting others. Before the introduction
                            of ART in the mid-1990s, people with HIV could progress to AIDS in just a few years. Today, someone diagnosed with HIV and 
                            treated before the disease is far advanced can live nearly as long as someone who does not have HIV.</p>   
                        <br>
                        <h2>Where did HIV come from?</h2>
                        <hr>
                            <p>Scientists identified a type of chimpanzee in Central Africa as the source of HIV infection in humans. They believe that the 
                            chimpanzee version of the immunodeficiency virus (called simian immunodeficiency virus, or SIV) most likely was transmitted to humans 
                            and mutated into HIV when humans hunted these chimpanzees for meat and came into contact with their infected blood. Studies show that HIV 
                            may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s. Over decades, the virus slowly spread across Africa and later into other 
                            parts of the world. We know that the virus has existed in the United States since at least the mid to late 1970s. To learn more about the 
                            spread of HIV in the United States and CDC’s response to the epidemic, see CDC’s HIV and AIDS Timeline.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>What are the stages of HIV infection?</h2>
                        <hr>
                            <p>Without treatment, HIV advances in stages, overwhelming your immune system and getting worse over time. The three stages of HIV infection 
                            are: (1) acute HIV infection, (2) clinical latency, and (3) AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).However, there’s good news: by using
                            HIV medicines (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) consistently, you can prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS. ART helps control the virus
                            so that you can live a longer, healthier life and greatly reduces the risk of transmitting HIV to others.</p>
                            <p>These are the three stages of HIV infection:</p>
                        <h5>Acute HIV Infection Stage</h5>
                            <p>Within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV, people may experience a flu-like illness, which may last for a few weeks. This is the body’s natural
                            response to infection. When people have acute HIV infection, they have a large amount of virus in their blood and are very contagious. But people with 
                            acute infection are often unaware that they’re infected because they may not feel sick right away or at all. To know whether someone has acute infection, 
                            either an antigen/antibody test or a nucleic acid (NAT) test is necessary. If you think you have been exposed to HIV through sex or drug use and you have 
                            flu-like symptoms, seek medical care and ask for a test to diagnose acute infection.</p>
                        <h5>Clinical Latency Stage</h5>
                            <p>This period is sometimes called asymptomatic HIV infection or chronic HIV infection. During this phase, HIV is still active but reproduces at very low 
                            levels. People may not have any symptoms or get sick during this time. For people who aren’t taking medicine to treat HIV, this period can last a decade or longer,
                            but some may progress through this phase faster. People who are taking medicine to treat HIV (ART) as prescribed may be in this stage for several decades. It’s 
                            important to remember that people can still transmit HIV to others during this phase. However, people who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable 
                            viral load (or stay virally suppressed) have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative sexual partners. At the end of this phase, a person’s viral load 
                            starts to go up and the CD4 cell count begins to go down. As this happens, the person may begin to have symptoms as the virus levels increase in the body, and the person moves 
                            into Stage 3.</p>
                        <h5>AIDS</h5>
                            <p>AIDS is the most severe phase of HIV infection. People with AIDS have such badly damaged immune systems that they get an increasing number of severe illnesses, 
                            called opportunistic illnesses.</p>
                            <p>Without treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years. Common symptoms of AIDS include chills, fever, sweats, swollen lymph glands, weakness, and weight loss. 
                            People are diagnosed with AIDS when their CD4 cell count drops below 200 cells/mm or if they develop certain opportunistic illnesses. People with AIDS can have a high viral load 
                            and be very infectious.</p>
